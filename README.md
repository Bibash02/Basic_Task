# Task 1(Simple Calculator):
I developed a basic calculator using Python. It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
I used separate functions for each operation to maintain modularity. The program takes two user inputs and allows the user to select an operation through a menu. 
I also handled division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message instead of allowing the program to crash.

# Task 2(Number Guessing Game):
I created a number guessing game using Python. The program uses the random module to generate a number between 1 and 100. 
The user is given multiple attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback such as ‘Too high’ or ‘Too low’. 
The game ends when the user guesses correctly or when the maximum number of attempts is reached.

# Task 3(Word Counter): 
I developed a word counter program using Python. The program reads a text file, splits the content into words using whitespace as a delimiter, and counts the total number of words. 
I used exception handling to manage errors such as file not found, ensuring the program does not crash.
